          <h2 id="managed_service">What is included in the managed service?</h2>
          <p class="shortdesc">The fully managed service of Db2 on Cloud deploys in a few clicks and you can run your database without hassles. It&#39;s already optimized for you. The service handles any underlying software upgrades and hardware issues for you. The service
            includes 24x7 health monitoring of the database and infrastructure. Your on-disk data is encrypted and connections to the database are made with enhanced security. High availability plans provide seamless rolling updates and you can you scale
            your apps without downtime. For more information, see <a href="../Db2onCloud/ha.html" target="_blank">High Availability</a>.</p>
          <!-- ## User management

Management of users that were given access to the database is the sole responsibility of the user or users with the administrator role. The administrator has the responsibility to manage how other users in your organization access your database.

The database administrator role manages the following types of user access: 
* Web console. From the web console, users can run queries against the database.
* Database. The administrator can grant granular access permissions to the database, including only being able to access certain tables, schemas, or even rows or columns. 

For more information about user management, see [Database user management ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS6NHC/com.ibm.swg.im.dashdb.security.doc/doc/user_mgmnt.html){:new_window}

## Flexible scaling

Independent scaling of RAM, storage, and compute cores. 

Before provisioning your Flex system, you adjust your anticipated RAM, storage, and compute cores, then submit your choices.

After your system is provisioned and whenever your needs change, you can adjust your RAM, storage, and compute cores up or down. These dynamic adjustments typically take less than 20 minutes to complete. You can even scale CPU and RAM without any downtime by following these [guidelines ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/381931/how-can-i-scale-cpu-up-and-down-without-downtime-o.html){:new_window}.

## Backup and restore

Encrypted backups on the full Db2 managed service database are done daily. The last 14 daily backup snapshots are retained.

Retained backups are used exclusively by IBM for only system recovery purposes in the event of a disaster or system loss. A request to restore your database from a backup is not supported. Use the [Time Travel Query ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/426878/how-do-i-use-time-travel-query-in-db2-or-db2-on-cl.html){:new_window} to keep historical data for your own purposes. You can also perform your own exports using IBM Data Studio or any Db2 tool.

To store your backups at a remote storage site, make a request to IBM Support.

## High availability (HA)

Db2 on Cloud high availability plans have excellent availability characteristics with a 99.99% SLA. Through the web console, you can also add a disaster recovery (DR) node located in a datacenter of your choice. 

The standard high availability plans without a DR node provide seamless failover and rolling updates are managed for you by using automatic client reroute (ACR) and portable IPs.

High availability with a DR node gives you the ability to rapidly synchronize your data in real time to a database node that you can use as a failover node. Db2 on Cloud uses the Db2 High Availability Disaster Recovery (HADR) technology in ASYNC mode to achieve the offsite DR node capability.

## Audit

The following are methods by which you can audit activity on the Db2 on Cloud database:

* [CHANGE HISTORY event monitor ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEPGG_11.1.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0059363.html){:new_window}
* [Time Travel Query ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/426878/how-do-i-use-time-travel-query-in-db2-or-db2-on-cl/){:new_window}

By creating a CHANGE HISTORY event monitor, you can query the event monitor table to determine what was done within the database and by whom. 

The Time Travel Query makes it easy to store all of the changes to your data and even query your old data based on a selected point in time. To use this audit method, ensure that you first set up your tables to support Time Travel Query.

For more information about these audit methods, see [How do I audit or track changes? ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/427780/how-can-i-audit-or-track-changes-dropped-tables-to.html){:new_window}.

## Plans and configurations

You can choose a Db2 on Cloud plan that is configured and optimized for the work that you need to do:

   * An entry plan to try things out (Precise Performance 500 (2.8.500))
   * A Flex plan in which you can independently scale RAM, storage, and compute resources
   * Small, medium, and large plans for production
   * Plans configured for High Availability or for Oracle compatibility
   * And more ...

View available plans in the IBM&reg; Cloud catalog:
   * Plans configured for high-speed, online transaction processing (OLTP): [Db2 on Cloud](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/dashdb-for-transactions-sql-database){:new_window}

If you don't see a configuration in the catalog that you need, contact [IBM Sales ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/connect/ibm/us/en/?lnk=fcw){:new_window} to discuss other options.

## Loading data

You can load data from a data file in a delimited format such as CSV or TXT located on a local network, an object store (Amazon S3 or IBM Cloud Object Storage (formerly SoftLayer Swift)), or a Db2® server. You can also populate a database instance with data directly from a Cloudant® database or by performing a load process from an application such as InfoSphere® DataStage®.
