          <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
          <p>You can migrate WebSphere to the cloud and run it there. Lots of documentation about this.</p>
          <p>Use this tool to &quot;clone&quot; your Websphere implementation in the cloud and run v9 there:
            <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/#asset/tools-WebSphere_Configuration_Migration_Tool_for_IBM_Cloud" target="_blank">WebSphere Configuration Migration Tool for IBM Cloud <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon" title="External link icon"></a>.</p>
          <p>At this point, I see no docs that describe how to migrate WebSphere backend database to the cloud. Dalia provided link to doc that describes making a secure connection between WebSphere running in the cloud and its database located on premises
            by using a secure gateway.</p>
          <p>This topic could discuss migrating WebSphere and its database to the cloud. Any app-based database can be migrated traditionally with Lift. If WAS DB is small to store its cfgs, then it&#39;s not likely users will want to separate it from WAS
            installation location and risk perf hit. If a DB is created to store transactional data for an app, then that&#39;s the DB that is connected to thru WAS with its JCA spec connector facility. The DB is used by the app to retrieve and persist
            data.
            <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/welc6productov.html" target="_blank">WebSphere Application Server: Overview <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon" title="External link icon"></a></p>
          <p>Data from DBs can be migrated to a transactional DB in the cloud to store and retrieve tranasactional data, or to a warehouse DB to eventually be analyzed.</p>
