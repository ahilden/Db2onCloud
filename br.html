        <h1 id="br">Backup and restore</h1>
        <p class="shortdesc">For paid plans, encrypted backups of the database are done daily. A daily backup is kept for each of the last 14 days.</p>
        <p>Retained backups are used by IBM for system recovery purposes in the event of a disaster or system loss. Use the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/426878/how-do-i-use-time-travel-query-in-db2-or-db2-on-cl.html" target="_blank">Time Travel Query <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon" title="External link icon"></a>          to keep historical data for your own purposes. In addition, you can also perform your own exports using IBM Data Studio or any Db2 tool.</p>
        <p>To store your backups offsite at a remote storage site, make a request to IBM Support.</p>
        <p>You can also use <a href="https://lift.ng.bluemix.net/" target="_blank">IBM Lift CLI</a> to import data into Db2 on Cloud.</p>
