        <p class="shortdesc">For paid plans, encrypted backups of the database are done daily. A daily backup is kept for each of the last 14 days.</p>
        <p>In addition to standard backups, you can use the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/426878/how-do-i-use-time-travel-query-in-db2-or-db2-on-cl.html" target="_blank">Time Travel Query <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon" title="External link icon"></a>          to keep historical data for other purposes, such as instantly querying old data or simplified auditing. You can also perform your own exports using IBM Data Studio or any Db2 tool.</p>
        <p>For information about point-in-time restores, see <a href="#point-in-time">Point-in-time restore</a>.</p>
        <p>All paid plans typically make use of IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) to keep backups offsite in 3 different data centers. However, Sydney and certain smaller data centers might not support offsite replication with IBM COS at this time. Check the
          <a href="/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/basics/endpoints.html#select-regions-and-endpoints">IBM COS documentation</a> for your region to determine which regions support offsite replication.</p>
        <!-- Retained backups are used by IBM for system recovery purposes in the event of a disaster or system loss. Use the [Time Travel Query ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/426878/how-do-i-use-time-travel-query-in-db2-or-db2-on-cl.html){:new_window} to keep historical data for your own purposes. In addition, you can also perform your own exports using IBM Data Studio or any Db2 tool. -->

        <!-- To store your backups offsite at a remote storage site, make a request to IBM Support. -->

        <p>You can also use <a href="https://lift.ng.bluemix.net/" target="_blank">IBM Lift CLI <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon" title="External link icon"></a> to import data into Db2 on Cloud.</p>

          <p>Db2 on Cloud has added a point-in-time restore capability. You can restore to an exact point in time from your backups. </p>
          <p>The following is an availability list of the point-in-time restore feature:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dallas data center: Available today on single server systems</li>
            <li>Frankfurt, London data centers (non-EU Cloud region): Available Nov 29, 2018 on single server systems</li>
            <li>All other single server, baremetal, and HA or HADR systems (not in EU Cloud region, not on IBM Cloud Dedicated systems (formerly Bluemix Dedicated)): Available Dec 20, 2018</li>
            <li>EU Cloud region: Available by opening a support ticket, or by self-serve starting Jan 30, 2019</li>
            <li>IBM Cloud Dedicated system (formerly Bluemix Dedicated): Only available by opening a support ticket.</li>
          </ul>
