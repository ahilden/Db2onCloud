        <p>The maintenance and notification policies for the IBM&reg; Db2&reg; on Cloud service can be found in the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/sla/bm?OpenDocument" target="_blank">IBM Cloud service descriptions <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon" title="External link icon"></a>.
          Additional terms of service specifically for Db2 on Cloud can be found by looking under the <strong>Chargeable additional SDs</strong> category. </p>
        <p class="shortdesc">Being acquainted with our policies can better help you plan and schedule your workloads to be resilient to system maintenance.</p>

          <h2 id="maintenance">Maintenance policy</h2>
          <p>Effective as of March 27, 2018, in the event that scheduled system maintenance must be done for the Db2 on Cloud service, the major data centers (London, Dallas, and Sydney) are updated on separate days of the business week. All of the other
            data centers are simultaneously updated on a day of the week that doesn&#39;t coincide with the major data centers. Table 1 shows an example of a Db2 on Cloud system maintenance schedule.</p>

          <h2 id="notification">Notification policy</h2>
          <p>Effective as of March 27, 2018, notification is sent to you two business days in advance of any scheduled system maintenance that can impact your Db2 on Cloud service. </p>
          <p>The Db2 on Cloud notification policy excludes the case in which we must address, in a timely manner, any security vulnerability that we deem to be an emergency-grade, time-sensitive issue. In that case, at least 24 hours advance notice is given
            as stipulated in the IBM Cloud service descriptions.</p>
