          <p class="shortdesc">You can choose a Db2 on Cloud plan that is configured and optimized for the work that you need to do:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A Flex plan (recommended) in which you can independently scale RAM, storage, and compute resources</li>
            <li>Precise Performance plans that provide fixed resources and baremetal servers</li>
            <li>Each plan can be configured for high availability and Oracle compatibility.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For heavy analytics or warehousing workloads, consider <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/db2-warehouse-on-cloud" target="_blank">IBM&reg; Db2&reg; Warehouse on Cloud <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon" title="External link icon"></a>.</p>

          <h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>
          <p>Prices are stated in monthly terms (for example, $189 USD per month) for an activated service. </p>
          <p>If the activated service is terminated before the month has completed, the monthly price reflects the portion of the month during which the service remained activated.</p>
          <section id="section-examples">
            <h3 id="examples">Billing examples</h3>
            <p>In the following billing examples, an example plan charge of $189 USD per month is used.</p>
            <p><strong>Example 1: Monthly billing</strong></p>
            <p>As long as the service remains activated for each monthly billing period, a charge of $189 USD per month is billed even if the service sits idle.</p>
            <p><strong>Example 2: Daily billing</strong></p>
            <p>Billing for Flex plans is based on peak daily usage. For example, if you scale up from 2 to 8 cores for one hour of a day, you will be billed for 8 cores for only that day, and 2 cores for all of the other days of the month.</p>
            <p><strong>Example 3: Prorated billing</strong></p>
            <p>If an activated service with a monthly charge of $189 USD per month was used for 20 days out of the 30 days in the month before the service was terminated, the bill for the usage would be $189 USD x 20/30 = $126 USD.</p>
