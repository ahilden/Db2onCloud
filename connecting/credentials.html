        <p class="shortdesc">To configure your local development environment and to connect applications and tools to your Db2 on Cloud database, you need to know the database details and connection credentials.</p>
        <section id="section-db_details">
          <h2 id="db_details">Database details</h2>
          <p>There are important database details needed for connecting applications and tools to your database:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Host name</em> - The host name of the server.</li>
            <li>
              <p><em>Port number</em> - Used by the database manager for TCP/IP communication. (Note that your service is provisioned with one port number for connections that use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and a different port for non-SSL connection.)</p>
              <p> If needed, you can get the IP address of your server by using the ping command or the nslookup command, specifying your host name.</p>
            </li>
            <li><em>Database name</em> - The Db2 database name, usually BLUDB.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="section-cxn_creds">
          <h2 id="cxn_creds">Connection credentials</h2>
          <p>There are three types of credentials:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>IBMid</em> - If you use IBM Cloud, this is the ID you would use to log in to IBM Cloud. This is not what you use to connect applications or tools to your Db2 on Cloud database.</li>
            <li><em>Db2 database credentials</em> - Your service comes provisioned with a database user ID and password that can be used to connect applications and tools to your database.</li>
            <li><em>Administrator-created users</em> - Some Db2 on Cloud plans allow administrative users to create new users. These administrator-created user IDs and passwords can be used to log directly into the web console URL and to connect to the Db2
              database from applications or tools.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="section-location">
          <h2 id="location">Where to find database details and connection credentials</h2>
          <p>You can collect this information from the following places:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Your administrator</em> - If you are not the owner or administrator of your Db2 instance, you can get your database details and connect credentials from your administrator.</li>
            <li><em>Db2 web console</em> - Database details and credentials are available in the web console.</li>
            <li>
              <p>If you are using IBM Cloud: </p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>IBM Cloud Dashboard</em> - When you view your service on your IBM Cloud dashboard, in the &quot;Service credentials&quot; area, you can view the database details as well as the database user ID and password.</li>
                <li><em><code>VCAP_SERVICES</code></em> - <code>VCAP_SERVICES</code> is an environment variable in IBM Cloud that contains database details and credentials in JSON format. When you view the service credentials for your service in your IBM
                  Cloud dashboard, the contents of <code>VCAP_SERVICES</code> is what is displayed. When you bind other IBM Cloud services or apps to your service, those other services or apps can access database details and credentials programmatically
                  by reading <code>VCAP_SERVICES</code>.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
